# Context

This project aims to explore the current landscape of data professions globally, providing insightful visualizations and key information to help individuals assess a career change into the field of data analytics (DA).

For this, a hypothetical case was defined with a client that is assessing a career shift to DA.

## Client’s profile:

*`Name:`* Jessica Schultz Garrido 👨🏽‍💻

*`Residence:`* Frankfurt, Germany 🇩🇪

*`Age:`* 33

- The client is willing to relocate if profitable.
- Hybrid and remote work are preferred.
- No previous experience on IT, but willing to learn skills on demand.

Some hypotheses framed for the EDA of this data set are:

 1. There are not many hybrid nor remote opportunities for DA based on data from 2022-2024.
 2. DA with entry level are on demand.
 3. It is more profitable to relocate out of Germany.
